This folder contains all necessary files for the Riboflavin 
example in the real data section. The files are created for 
parallel computing on VSC. The R file named "WrapFull_wrapper.R" 
and the batch file "WrapFull.pbs" are used for running jobs 
on VSC. 

To execute locally, please load the file "Riboflavin_dataset.R" 
and run the implemented function "abalone(s)" where the argument 
s refers to the pseudo seed number.

The dataset used is in the "riboflavin_data_prepare" folder.
